        "description": "Nov 19, 2024 - Vindhya announced publication of three research reports pertaining to associations between dental/oral health services and autoimmune disease, diabetes and chronic kidney disease - conditions affecting millions within the United States and worldwide. The research was conducted under contracts with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), Rockville, MD. Information contained in the reports will enable patients, providers and payers to make informed decisions, potentially improving the quality of healthcare services and outcomes. \n\n Knowledge gaps bridged by these reports include the impact of non-surgical periodontal procedures on outcomes in patients undergoing treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (an autoimmune disease), the impact of dental/oral health services on glycemic control in patients with diabetes and in patients with end stage renal disease. Each of these diseases is characterized by a systemic inflammatory state. A common finding across these studies is that non-surgical periodontal treatments appear to reduce circulating levels of inflammatory markers in patients. \n\n Information within these reports follows from a rigorous rapid literature review accompanied by input from subject matter experts. “I am proud of our data scientists who incorporated quality metrics, including risk of bias, into extracting data from both primary studies and systematic reviews, enabling determination of the strength of evidence for the various outcomes of interest. Evidence tables have been mapped to key question responses” said Anupama Reddy, PhD, co-founder and Chief Operating Officer. \n\n \"It is truly rewarding to learn that these findings are influencing policy\" added Nanguneri Nirmala, PhD, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is amending regulations to include reimbursement for certain dental diagnostics and services linked to Medicare-covered dialysis services. CMS also solicited comment on the potential connection between dental services and covered services used for treatment of diabetes, and covered services for individuals with autoimmune diseases receiving immunosuppressive therapies.",

        "description": "Is non-coding RNA truly “non-coding”? This month, the Vindhya Data Science journal club reviewed a paper by Barczak et al., titled \"Long non-coding RNA-derived peptides are immunogenic and drive a potent anti-tumour response\" from Nature Communications. This paper explores long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes as a source of immunogenic peptides that can be harnessed for cancer vaccines.\n\nThe study first investigated two genes deregulated in cancer - protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT5 and the master transcription regulator E2F1 and their role in lncRNA regulation. After inhibiting PRMT5 and searching for differentially expressed lncRNAs with E2F1 binding sites, the authors found evidence of MHC class I protein-associated peptides encoded by small open reading frames in lncRNA genes. When these lncRNA-derived peptides were introduced to the immune system, the team observed a CD8 T lymphocyte response and delay in tumor growth.\n\nThe implications of this research are vast. GENCODE catalogs > 16,000 lncRNA genes in the hg38 reference. While some connections between certain lncRNAs and cancer have been established, the broader role of lncRNAs in malignancy remains unclear. This paper explains how some lncRNA genes may harbor a novel source of immunogenic tumor antigens. It is exciting to imagine potential applications of lncRNA-encoded peptides in engineering patient-specific cancer vaccines.",

        "description": "This month's Vindhya Data Science Journal Club focused on a paper by Chen et al., \"Context-aware transcript quantification from long-read RNA-seq data with Bambu.\" The paper presents Bambu, a tool that leverages machine learning for context-aware quantification of long-read RNA sequencing data. Bambu addresses challenges in long-read RNA sequencing, such as uninformative transcripts from transcriptional noise and other factors. Bambu works by using an ML model that assigns a single transcript probability score to each read after considering multiple alignment features. This approach simplifies novel isoform catalog curation and enhances the accuracy of transcript quantification. In the image below, it is clear that their metrics are superior to read-count-based filtering alone.\n\nThe advancements in long-read RNA sequencing have important implications for cancer research, where the method has identified cancer-specific pro-tumorigenic isoforms. Tools like Bambu aid in uncovering new drug targets and deepening our understanding of potential therapeutic compounds' mechanisms. In biotechnology and drug discovery, such progress is vital, paving the way for a more thorough understanding of complex biological systems and the development of novel therapies. We're excited to incorporate these insights into our work. Stay tuned for more Journal Club updates.",

By adjusting the network architecture, they remarkably improved the accuracy of image translation in virtual H&E staining.\n\nThe applications of these findings for our work in spatial profiling are particularly compelling. With these advanced neural network techniques, we can identify signatures of pathogenic cell neighborhoods using just unstained slides. This opens up a whole new avenue for understanding the spatial organization of cells and their interactions. Additionally, these techniques may maximize our insights from single probe immunohistochemistry (IHC), potentially requiring minimal further high-plex analysis, conserving resources, and saving time in the clinic. As we integrate these exciting advancements into our work, we're set to redefine the boundaries of what's possible in tumor imaging and spatial analysis. Stay tuned for more updates!",
